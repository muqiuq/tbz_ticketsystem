 ```shell
git clone https://github.com/muqiuq/tbz_ticketsystem/

# Installation tips - zammad

```shell
docker container run -ti -d --name zammad -p 80:80 zammad/zammad
```
 - You can start the stopped container using
```shell
docker container start zammad
```
 - And to stop use
 ```shell
 docker container stop zammad
 ```

# Docker Tips:
 - You may have to create a network proxy and service first (you'll receive a warning)
 ```shell
docker network create proxy
docker network create shell
```
 - If your running VirtualBox: Install [lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/) and then [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose] (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
 - You can use this command to run it in background. 
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
 - With this command you can stop the containers.
```shell
docker-compose down
```
 - Display all currently active containers:
```shell
docker ps
```
 - Display all containers
```shell
docker container ls -a
```
 - You can then use this command to delete the containers
```shell
docker-compose rm
```
 - Data persistance is implemented by mounting two folders (data and db) within the current directory (where you ran docker-compose). **Backup this folders!**
